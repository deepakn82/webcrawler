The script uses playright library from python and crawls the website.
For testing I have used https://www.python.org.
Pl refer to the output folder in the dir to view the final outcome of the script execution.
The script will be running in headed mode of playright that will allow you to see the actual execution of script not only at the prompt level, but also at the UI level.
The default max-depth for each page is set to 50, you can change the same in crawl function at line 197
